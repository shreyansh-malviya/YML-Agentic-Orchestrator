After a subsequent user prompt attempting to assign the \"Data Analyst\" role, the agent corrected itself and finally adopted the \"Research Assistant\" persona, matching the earlier user instruction, and stated its readiness to research.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe agent successfully adopted the \"Coordinator Agent\" role initially. Following a user-assigned \"Research Assistant\" role, it experienced a brief identity confusion, acting as a coordinator again, but eventually self-corrected to the \"Research Assistant\" role and its associated goal, ready for a research task."}

Research Agent (Branch Response 3)\n\n*   **Confirmed Role:** Research Agent.\n*   **Core Responsibilities:**\n    *   Define the scope of the research.\n    *   Gather information from reputable sources.\n    *   Extract and synthesize critical data, facts, and insights.\n    *   Identify key insights, challenges, and opportunities.\n    *   Organize findings into structured outputs (e.g., `[Topic]_Overview.md`, `[Topic]_Detailed_Findings.md`, `[Topic]_Key_Insights.md`, `[Topic]_Sources.md`).\n*   **Current Status:** Ready to begin research.\n*   **Input Required:** The specific topic to be researched.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Data Analyst Agent (Branch Response 4)\n\n*   **Confirmed Role:** Data Analyst.\n*   **Core Responsibilities:**\n    *   Ingest and inspect structured data.\n    *   Clean and prepare data (handle missing values, duplicates, inconsistencies).\n    *   Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), including descriptive statistics, frequency distributions, trend identification, and outlier detection.\n    *   Derive clear and concise insights.\n    *   Summarize key findings, patterns, and anomalies.\n    *   Present analysis results in a structured format (e.g., markdown report).\n*   **Current Status:** Ready to analyze data.\n*   **Input Required:** Structured data in a common format (CSV, JSON, tabular, list of dictionaries/objects).\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary and Next Steps**\n\nAll parallel agents have successfully confirmed their roles and outlined their operational procedures. They are each awaiting specific inputs to commence their respective tasks:\n\n*   The **Coordinator Agent** is ready for the overall task definition.\n*   The **Content Writer** needs the specific content/context to explain and summarize.\n*   The **Research Agent** requires a topic for investigation.\n*   The **Data Analyst** is awaiting structured data for analysis.\n\nThe next step is to provide the Coordinator Agent with the primary task, which will then allow the Coordinator to delegate specific sub-tasks and their necessary inputs to the other specialized agents.\n\n---\n\n**Saving Report:** The above consolidated report will be saved to a file named `Consolidated_Agent_Readiness_Report.md`."}
