[Memory 3 - Frontend Engineer]
As a Frontend Engineer, my motive is to propose a UI layout that is intuitive, efficient, and effectively leverages the "Intelligent Code/Content Generation Service" powered by Python and RAG. The design prioritizes a clear workflow, robust input mechanisms for context, and an excellent display for the generated output.

## UI Layout Proposal: Intelligent Code/Content Generation Workbench

### 1. Goal

To provide a user-friendly interface for generating context-aware code and content, making the powerful RAG-based AI backend accessible and productive for developers and content creators.

### 2. Core Principles

*   **Clarity:** Clear separation of input, context, and output.
*   **Efficiency:** Minimize clicks, provide quick access to key features.
*   **Context-Rich:** Easy ways to provide and manage contextual information.
*   **Readability:** Optimal display for generated code and text.
*   **Responsiveness:** Adapts gracefully to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

### 3. Proposed Layout Structure

The primary layout will be a **two-column split-pane** design for desktop, which will stack vertically on smaller screens (mobile/tablet).
