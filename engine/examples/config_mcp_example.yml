# Example MCP Tools Configuration
# This demonstrates how to use MCP tools in your YAML workflow
# NOTE: The 'tools' section is now OPTIONAL - all MCP servers load automatically by default

# Optional: Custom Tools Configuration
# You can override default tools or add custom MCP servers
# tools:
#   filesystem:
#     server: "python"
#     args: ["engine/mcp_servers/simple_mcp_server.py"]
#     env: {}
#   github:
#     server: "python"
#     args: ["engine/mcp_servers/simple_github_mcp_server.py"]
#     env: {}
#   calculator:
#     server: "python"
#     args: ["engine/mcp_servers/simple_calculator_mcp_server.py"]
#     env: {}
#   custom_tool:
#     server: "node"
#     args: ["path/to/custom_server.js"]
#     env:
#       API_KEY: "your-api-key"

# Agents Configuration
agents:
  - id: file_creator
    name: "File Manager Agent"
    role: "Creates and manages files using MCP filesystem tools"
    model: "groq:llama-3.1-8b-instant"
    max_tokens: 1000
    temperature: 0.7

  - id: math_worker
    name: "Calculator Agent"
    role: "Performs mathematical calculations using MCP calculator tools"
    model: "groq:llama-3.1-8b-instant"
    max_tokens: 800
    temperature: 0.5

  - id: github_searcher
    name: "GitHub Research Agent"
    role: "Searches GitHub repositories using MCP github tools"
    model: "groq:llama-3.1-8b-instant"
    max_tokens: 1200
    temperature: 0.6

  - id: report_generator
    name: "Report Generator"

# Workflow Definition
workflow:
  mode: sequential
  steps:
    - agent: file_creator
      task: |
        Create a file called 'mcp_demo.txt' in the workspace directory with the following content:
        "This file was created using MCP filesystem tools.
        
        MCP (Model Context Protocol) enables AI agents to interact with external tools.
        Available tools: filesystem, github, calculator"
    
    - agent: math_worker
      task: |
        Using the calculator tools, perform the following calculations and save results:
        1. Add 150 and 275
        2. Calculate 25% of 1000
        3. Find the average of [45, 78, 92, 63, 88]
        4. Calculate 2 to the power of 10
        
        Create a file called 'calculations.txt' with all the results.
    
    - agent: github_searcher
      task: |
        Search GitHub for repositories related to "Model Context Protocol".
        Find the top 3 repositories by stars.
        Save the repository names and star counts to 'github_results.txt'.
    
    - agent: report_generator
      task: |
        Read all three files created by previous agents:
        - mcp_demo.txt
        - calculations.txt  
        - github_results.txt
        
        Compile them into a comprehensive markdown report called 'mcp_workflow_report.md'
        with sections for each type of operation (filesystem, calculations, github).
        Include a summary of what was accomplished.
