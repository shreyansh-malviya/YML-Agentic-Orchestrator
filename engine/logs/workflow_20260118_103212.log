**Test Date:** January 18, 2026
**Test Status:** Passed

**Basic Operations Results**

The basic arithmetic operations were tested using the calculator tools. The results are as follows:

1. **Add 150 and 75**
Using the calculator tool: `calculator.add(150, 75)`
Result: 225
This result means that 150 + 75 equals 225.

2. **Subtract 200 from 500**
Using the calculator tool: `calculator.subtract(500, 200)`
Result: 300
This result means that 500 - 200 equals 300.

3. **Multiply 25 by 8**
Using the calculator tool: `calculator.multiply(25, 8)`
Result: 200
This result means that 25 * 8 equals 200.

4. **Divide 144 by 12**
Using the calculator tool: `calculator.divide(144, 12)`
Result: 12
This result means that 144 / 12 equals 12.

**Advanced Operations Results**

The advanced mathematical operations were tested using the calculator tools. The results are as follows:

1. **Calculate 2 to the power of 8**
Using the calculator tool: `calculator.power(2, 8)`
Result: 256
This result means that 2 raised to the power of 8 equals 256. In mathematical notation, this is written as 2^8 = 256.

2. **Find the square root of 256**
Using the calculator tool: `calculator.sqrt(256)`
Result: 16
This result means that the square root of 256 is 16. In mathematical notation, this is written as √256 = 16.

3. **Calculate 25% of 800**
Using the calculator tool: `calculator.percentage(800, 25)`
Result: 200
This result means that 25% of 800 is equal to 200. In mathematical notation, this is written as 25% of 800 = 200.

4. **Find the average of these numbers: 85, 92, 78, 95, 88**
Using the calculator tool: `calculator.average([85, 92, 78, 95, 88])`
Result: 88
This result means that the average of the given numbers is 88. To find the average, we add up all the numbers and divide by the total count of numbers. In this case, the sum is 85 + 92 + 78 + 95 + 88 = 438, and there are 5 numbers, so the average is 438 / 5 = 88.

**Error Handling Verification**

The error handling of the calculator was tested by trying operations that should fail. The results are as follows:

1. **Try dividing 100 by 0**
Using the calculator tool: `calculator.divide(100, 0)`
Error: Division by zero is not allowed.
This result means that the calculator correctly handled the error and returned an error message.

2. **Try square root of -25**
Using the calculator tool: `calculator.sqrt(-25)`
Error: Square root of a negative number is not allowed.
This result means that the calculator correctly handled the error and returned an error message.

**Conclusion**

All operations have been tested successfully. The basic arithmetic operations, advanced mathematical operations, and error handling have been verified to work correctly. The calculator tools have been thoroughly tested, and no issues were found.

**Final Calculation**

The final calculation is to add up the test scores:
85 + 92 + 78 + 95 + 88 = 438

Divide 144 by 12\nUsing the calculator tool: calculator.divide(144, 12)\nResult: 12\nThis result means that 144 / 12 equals 12.\n\nAdvanced Operations Results\n\n1. Calculate 2 to the power of 8\nUsing the calculator tool: calculator.power(2, 8)\nResult: 256\nThis result means that 2 raised to the power of 8 equals 256. In mathematical notation, this is written as 2^8 = 256.\n\n2. Find the square root of 256\nUsing the calculator tool: calculator.sqrt(256)\nResult: 16\nThis result means that the square root of 256 is 16. In mathematical notation, this is written as √256 = 16.\n\n3. Calculate 25% of 800\nUsing the calculator tool: calculator.percentage(800, 25)\nResult: 200\nThis result means that 25% of 800 is equal to 200. In mathematical notation, this is written as 25% of 800 = 200.\n\n4. Find the average of these numbers: 85, 92, 78, 95, 88\nUsing the calculator tool: calculator.average([85, 92, 78, 95, 88])\nResult: 88\nThis result means that the average of the given numbers is 88. To find the average, we add up all the numbers and divide by the total count of numbers. In this case, the sum is 85 + 92 + 78 + 95 + 88 = 438, and there are 5 numbers, so the average is 438 / 5 = 88.\n\nError Handling Verification\n\n1. Try dividing 100 by 0\nUsing the calculator tool: calculator.divide(100, 0)\nError: Division by zero is not allowed.\nThis result means that the calculator correctly handled the error and returned an error message.\n\n2. Try square root of -25\nUsing the calculator tool: calculator.sqrt(-25)\nError: Square root of a negative number is not allowed.\nThis result means that the calculator correctly handled the error and returned an error message.\n\nConclusion\n\nAll operations have been tested successfully. The basic arithmetic operations, advanced mathematical operations, and error handling have been verified to work correctly. The calculator tools have been thoroughly tested, and no issues were found.\n\nFinal Calculation\n\nThe final calculation is to add up the test scores:\n85 + 92 + 78 + 95 + 88 = 438")
